# Directives For All AI Agents

- Try not to run hcsbuilder.py directly -- use the helper scripts instead
- DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE!
- DO NOT TOUCH `./todo.md`! If a task is sure to be logically completed, notify your user
- Preserve all code comments in all scripts unless instructed otherwise
- Changes to hcsbuilder.py help text must be reflected in HCSBUILDER-README.txt
- Use the Google Java Style Guide (<https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html>) for variable naming and code conventions in hcsbuilder.py where applicable, HOWEVER for function parameter names, use snake_case.

## In the event that your agents are ignoring these directives

Say: `Enforce the directives in ./AI-AGENTS-MUST-READ.md`

## (To Users) Always start the first editing task prompt in a new conversation with the following

Say: `Read ./AI-AGENTS-MUST-READ.md first.`
